Goals

Format
- what's being told
	- what's being shown
OR
- supertext
	- subtext


PRAGMATIC
- Oliver and Sasha talk about whats their parents are making for dinner
Oliver takes a little bit to response, perhaps even not having heard
maybe Oliver asks, wanting to start a convo, unsure what to bring up
	- Oliver and Sasha are both younger teens (15ish)
	- subtly shows something's on Oliver's mind

- Sasha wants to show Oliver a drawing she's been working on
either doesn't show much interest, to lead the convo to other stuff, or says "show me later"
	- Oliver and Sasha are both younger teens (15ish)
	- Show's a little bit of her interests
	- Implies they hang out like this most nights

- Sasha expresses doing something in two weeks, forgets that Oliver's moving out in two weeks
	- "wanna do bla?"
	- "i can't, remember?
	- "the move's in two weeks?"
	"*sigh* Yeah..."
		- Oliver has home issues (might not even need this)
	- two weeks until Oliver's moving

- Dad knocks on Oliver's door to give him his dinner.
- He asks who he was talking to, and is given a cold response
- He comments on the messiness of his room, before leaving.
	- Dad & son relationship is not great. Dad is cold, son is closed off.
	- The move is maybe related?
	- Oliver shows mental health struggles

- "i heard a little bit of that"
OR
it isn't brought up (unsure which one to go with)

- Oliver expresses wanting to go to Sasha's place. "Could I come over tonight? Sorry..."
make it very subtle, only express that
	- wants to avoid home
	- is comfortable around Sasha
	- Oliver & Sasha are close enough to ask this (maybe this idea can be shown earlier too)


AESTHETIC
- the scene is that of being on a desktop wallpaper
	- peaceful
	- hanging out with friend on Discord
- in bedroom is dark, isolating
