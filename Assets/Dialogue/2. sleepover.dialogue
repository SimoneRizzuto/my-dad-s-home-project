#Friend and Oliver are in a bedroom together, playing video games while huddled next to each other.
#Someone wins, and then Oliver gets up to walk around the room. There are things to interact with.

Oliver: NO WAY!
Sasha: YES!
Sasha: Woo!
Oliver: That was SO UNLUCKY!
Sasha: Hey, what I can I say? They call me the drift queen!
Oliver: No one says that...

do Director.Wait(3)

Oliver: Ok, it's bathroom time!
Sasha: Don’t fall in.
Oliver: Hey, that’s my line!
Sasha: You literally stole that from Sahara.
Oliver: Sorry, I can't hear you!

Oliver: When did you get so good at Marco Kart?
Sasha: I’ve always been good. It was just bubbling under the surface.
Oliver: Hey, look.
Oliver: I don't wanna say it, but I WAS going easy on you.
Sasha: Oh yeah? Is that why you lost four times in a row?
Oliver: ... Yeah, totally. Mhh mhh.
Sasha: You got me... Wow.

~ computer_interaction
Oliver: By the way, you never got to show me your drawings.
Sasha: Oh yeah!

#Friend gets up and walks to the computer. Merps are shown on the screen.

Sasha: Look at my little merps!
Oliver: Daaamn!
Sasha: Yeah!
Oliver: Are they different from the ones you drew the other day?
Sasha: Yes.
Sasha: Well, some are.
Sasha: The one on the right is the same reoccurring one. She’s called Potato.
Sasha: The other ones are just little guys I doodled.
Sasha: It’s been difficult to think of different kinds of merps, so I keep on resorting to the same plants.
Oliver: You should make a chocolate one.
Sasha: Uh? But it doesn’t fit what I have in mind for them. 
Sasha: They’re meant to be plant based.
Oliver: Cacao is technically a seed from a plant.
Sasha: Yes, cacao seeds are, but not chocolate. That’s different.
Oliver: Then do a cacao one. That would still be cool.
Sasha: Ok ok. I'll keep it in mind for next time.
Oliver: Hell yeah!

~ pizza_carton_interaction
Oliver: Hey, you got Gigi's again!
Sasha: I wasn't lying when I said I liked it.
Oliver: So what you're telling me is...
Oliver: ...good pizza exists after all!
Sasha: I never said I didn't like pizza.
Sasha: It just isn't my first option.
Oliver: ... And yet clearly, you got Gigi's one time over something else.
Sasha: Ok, Olive Boy.
Oliver: Hey!
Oliver: That fits too well...
Sasha: Hehe~

#maybe iterate through dialogue if you keep on doing it
Sasha: Oliver!
Oliver: Sorry.

# version 2
Sasha: ...
Oliver: Your bed is bouncier than mine, ok?

# version 3
Sasha: Are you a child?
Oliver: ... No.
Oliver: I'm worse!
Oliver: I'm a teen with a problem.
# Oliver bounces on bed non stop until the next line
Oliver: A cripling addiction for bouncing on beds.
Sasha: If you break it, I'm coming to your new place to steal your bed.

#When rejoining his friend, this time, it is a campfire. No door separates the outside.

Oliver: ...
Sasha: You didn't fall in, did you?
Oliver: Pff.
Oliver: Not this time.

#Oliver sits next to the fireplace.

#Oliver looks around himself.
#Oliver closes his eyes.

Oliver: Ahhhh...
Oliver: ...
Oliver: Do you feel this warmth?
Sasha: Mhh?

do Director.Wait(2)

Sasha: Yeah, I do.

#Oliver opens his eyes. He lies down.

Oliver: I wish we had marshmallows.
Oliver: We could warm them up in a firepit, and just...
Oliver: Ooooh yeah. That would be awesome.
Sasha: I've never done that before.
Oliver: Me neither.
Sasha: What? I thought you were speaking from experience.
Oliver: I don't know. I haven't done many things.
Oliver: They make it look really nice in movies.
Oliver: Surely, it's just as nice in real life.
Sasha: I'm sure it is.
Oliver: When we're older, we should definitely go camping with the gang.
Oliver: It would be really fun to be out there, gathering wood for a fire, cooking dinner in it.
Sasha: As long as I can bring my sketchbook, I'm happy.
Oliver: True! And then you could draw your point of view, and capture the moment.
Oliver: That'd be cool.
Sasha: Eh. I'd rather draw something else.
Oliver: Well, I would do that... even if its a bad doodle.
Oliver: I'd try capture the moment myself. Through MY eyes.

do Director.Wait(3)

Oliver: What would YOU draw?
Sasha: ...

# she looks up to the sky

Sasha: I've heard the stars are clearer when away from a city.
Sasha: I think that'd be nice.

# do Director.Wait(2)

Sasha: I hope it's as pretty as I imagine it to be.
Sasha: You really think we'll do that one day?
Oliver: I hope so.
Oliver: Assuming the distance won't make it too hard.
Sasha: It doesn't have to be hard...
Oliver: I know.
Oliver: But you never know...
Sasha: Then promise to make the effort.
Oliver: ...

do Director.Wait(2)

Oliver: Ok, I promise.
Sasha: To?
Oliver: I promise to go camping with you sometime.
Sasha: Oliver...
Oliver: I-

do Oliver.PlayAnimation("look up")

Oliver: *small text* I promise to try.
Sasha: Good.

# rewrite this last bit

Oliver: I could fall asleep any time now...
Oliver: I don't... want to though...
Sasha: I'm sleepy.
Oliver: No... do not... succumb.
Sasha: Why?
Oliver: I'm having too much fun.
Oliver: I don't want tonight to end...
Sasha: Me too.
Sasha: But... we have to sleep.
Oliver: *sigh* I know.
Oliver: I guess it really is...
Oliver: ... sleepy time.
Sasha: Good night, Oli.
Oliver: Good night, Sasha.
