How old is Oliver? Either:
- 16
- 14
- 19, but visually, is 14. Later, it is revealed he is 19

Pragmatic Goals
- the player is on the internet
	- the scene is a vista of a tree, and a city in the distance. the player will walk over to the tree to trigger a cutscene with a friend
	- x they are placed there without explanation
	- x they do not know, but they may suspect
	- x must feel screen-saver esk
- a cutscene plays of Oliver & a friend spend time together over the internet
	- this is a almost daily occurance
	- show Sachi's name
	- x Sachi & Oliver are close friends, vaguely known to be friends for a few years now
	- x show Sachi's a drawer
	- x hint at Sachi's home situation
		- x when Sachi receives dinner, mention her mum giving her one of my favourite foods
		- x "mum's making me Sushi, im so excited. ill send you pics when i get it"
		- x this will hint at this conversation being over the internet
	- Oliver will vaguely hint at himself not feeling so great
		- it will be hinted at it being related to his living situation / relationship with his dad a home
		- Oliver will deflect for now
	- knocking on the door occurs, cutting this scene to another
- the cutscene continues, in Oliver's bedroom, where Oliver is on his computer
	- show some of Oliver's interests in the room
	- show messy room, implying adolescent "laziness"
	- the knocking is coming from the door, the dad passes him his dinner
	- his dad & Oliver's relationship is shown to be strict, distant, and passive aggressive
	- strong Italian roots
	- this heavily hints and confirms the living situation at home is bad, and partially why
		- the player does not know why their relationship is like this, but the absense of the mum + texts at the start will heavily hint at a breakup
	- dad leaves by slamming the door behind him
		- Oliver's heart is beating
		- Oliver puts on headset to rejoin call, no one is on
		- Oliver calms down
	- final bit of scene, tying up any lose ends of conversations, before Oliver asks if he can come over after dinner
		- Oliver quickly eats dinner
		- the player must walk past dad while he's on TV
